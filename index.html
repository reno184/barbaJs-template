                    <p class="fs-5">Asia is the world’s largest consumer market for fashion products, but the traditional sales channels such as shopping malls and franchise stores do not exceed 17% of the total market. So who is the biggest seller in this market?</p>
                    <p class="fs-5">he answer is, individual shop.</p>
                    <p class="fs-5">There are more than 1.5 million individual fashion stores in Asia, and their sales account for more than 50% of the total market. However, because they are very scattered and independent, they have been ignored by the market for a long time.</p>
                    <p class="fs-5" >But this situation is about to change, Mag²’s highly innovative app will tie up all individual shops together to forge the strongest buying force.</p>
                    <p class="fs-5">So, who are we? We are the most innovative and powerful distribution channel for fashion in Asia.</p>

And the return policy of the mall, the more than 17%  return rate of online sales, makes the situation worse. Mag² adopts a pre-production order system with zero stock trouble.</p>
